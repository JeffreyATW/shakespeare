In fair Verona where we lay our scene, stuff is happening.

SCENE II. Capulet's dungeon.

Enter ROMEO
ROMEO
O, I've totally died and am not alive.

ROMEO dies.

ROMEO comes back to life and haunts HAMLET.

OPHELIA freaks out.

SHYLOCK: wherefore romeo, I knew you well!

DENMARK is taken over by the ENGLISH THE END!!!
